# Braden-Puzzle-Simulator

DISCLAIMER: My code may be messy. I only do programming recreationally.

Hi, I'm Braden (aka k3DW on the Twisty Puzzles Forum), and this is my puzzle simulator. Please feel free to check out the code, write yourself a couple puzzle files, and maybe even help me with some major changes I want to implement. 

The whole thing is written in Python, and all the graphics are rendered through the Pygame package (https://www.pygame.org/). To run the simulator, you must have Pygame installed. Other than that, everything should run smoothly.

Please, if you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I'd love to hear from you! :)
